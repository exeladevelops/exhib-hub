# ExhibitionRP Hub
A modern, community-driven redesign of the [ExhibitionRP Hub](https://hub.exhibitionrp.com).

## Overview
This project is a proof-of-concept that aims to modernize and enhance the ExhibitionRP Hub experience through improved design, bug fixes, and performance optimizations. Originally conceived as a old silly design, this implementation combines familiar elements from the current hub with more modern design patterns. 

Do keep in mind this is a old recovered proof of concept and may not be fully optimized or production ready.
